# neovim-lua
This is my config for neovim created using lua.

## Motivation
- With the deprecation of nvim-lsp-installer and its replacement mason, and the increasingly large amount of plugins designed to be used with lua, I've decided to rewrite 
my config in lua.
- Writing this will also help me understand another programming language that could be useful for other things, compared to vimscript, which is somewhat esoteric and single use.
